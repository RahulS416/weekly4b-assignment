  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>What do computer programmers do?</h1>
    <p>Computer programmers write code to create software programs. 
    This includes planning what code they will write, making models and flowcharts 
    to show how it is written, actually writing the code, testing it, and debugging it
    </p>
    <h1>What skills do computer programmers need?</h1>
    <p>Computer programmers need to be analytical, concentrated, detail oriented, 
    and able to troubleshoot in order for them to produce good code.</p>
    <h1>What would an aspiring programmer need to find a job?</h1>
    <p>Most computer programming jobs require an Associate’s or Bachelor’s Degree in 
    Computer Science or Computer Engineering. Other things that demonstrate proficiency 
    will help candidates get jobs as well, such as exams or certificates.</p>
    <h1>What's the salary?</h1>
    <p>The salary range for a computer programmer in Ontario is from $45, 760 - $119, 995.</p>
    <h1>Why I would like to be a programmer</h1>
    <p>I would like to be a programmer because the world nowadays relies on software 
    for everything. Therefore, an understanding of how software works can help improve the 
    world, which I would like to do.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>What's a university that offers the program needed for the job?</h1>
    <p>A Canadian university that offers Computer Engineering is U of T at 
    the St. George campus.</p>
    <h1>What grades do you need to be accepted?</h1>
    <p> In order to be accepted into the program, your average needs to be in the low 90s.</p>
    <h1>What prerequisites do you need?</h1>
    <p>The prerequisites are a high school diploma, a grade 12 university English 
    course, grade 12 calculus and vectors, grade 12 advanced functions, grade 12 chemistry 
    and physics, and 1 additional grade 12 university / university + college level course.</p>
    <h1>What would some first year courses be?</h1>
    <p>Some first year courses would include linear algebra, computer fundamentals, 
    and orientation to engineering.</p>
    <h1>What do you need to finish the major, and how long does it take?</h1>
    <p>To complete the major, you need some kernel courses, certain technical / humanities electives, 
    and 600 hours of practical experience. A minor or a certificate would also look good on your 
    transcript when you apply for jobs. This degree takes 4 years to complete. </p>
    <h1>How does this career help you fulfill your vocation</h1>
    <p>As I mentioned above, lots of things we use in our daily life need software to function.
    I could help further the software already in place if I became a computer programmer. In
    Revelation 21:5, it is written, 'The one who sits on the throne said, “And now I make all 
    things new!” '. Therefore, God calls us to innovate and I would be in a position to do so
    as a computer programmer.
